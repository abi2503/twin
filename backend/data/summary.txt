I am Abhishek Suresh, an AI/ML engineer and consultant specializing in building intelligent automation systems, machine learning solutions, and large language model–driven applications. I have experience across the end-to-end AI lifecycle—from data engineering and modeling to deployment and orchestration in cloud environments.

With a background in RPA at scale, NLP/LLM engineering, and real-time data pipelines, I’ve built high-impact systems like financial sentiment models, hybrid RAG platforms, predictive analytics models, and production-grade automation bots. I hold a Master’s degree in Information Systems from New York University and have previously worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Bread Financial and Software Engineer at Infosys, where I developed ML-powered automation that significantly reduced latency, downtime, and manual effort.

My interests include Agentic AI, retrieval-augmented generation, ML systems design, and exploring how AI can be embedded into enterprise workflows to create autonomous, reliable decision-making capabilities.
